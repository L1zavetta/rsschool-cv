## About me
I am 18 years old.
I've been interested in front-end development for about a year now.
I have studied a little, so now I want to take up programming more closely.
In order to achieve my goals, I  changed my faculty at university.
I believe I have the character qualities that are necessary to achieve success in development: diligence, perfectionism and responsibility.
